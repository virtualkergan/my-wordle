## motivation

I wanted a chance to practice creating a GUI using the javax.swing framework. I also wanted to design and implement a project on my own using the content that I learned in my CSC 116 introductory computer science class at NCSU.

## notes

The WordListFormat.java source file was used to create the wordle-wordlist.csv file. I pulled the Wordle word list directly from the source code of the New York Times website and reformatted it using this source file.
