## motivation

I wanted a chance to practice creating a GUI using the javax.swing framework.

## notes

The WordListFormat.java source file was used to create the wordle-wordlist.csv file. I pulled the Wordle word list directly from the source code of the New York Times website and reformatted it using this source file.
